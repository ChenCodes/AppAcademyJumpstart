#Ruby Repo full of Coding Goodies

###Listed below is a detailed documentation of what methods/algorithms you will find in which file. 

####Jack_Chen.rb:
>Factorial

>Longest word count (return the number of words longer than 7 characters)

>Least common multiple

>Largest odd factors

>Fibonacci

>Hipsterfy

>Pair Product Given an array of numbers and a target product, return whether any pair of elements in the array multiplied together equals that product.

>Repeated Characters


####problem-set-1.rb
>Array times two

>Return unique array elements

>Slippery numbers -> A Slippery Number is a number is that has 3 as a factor or has 5 as a factor, but does *not* have both as factors. For example, 6 is a Slippery Number, but 30 is not. Write a function that given an N, returns an array of the first N Slippery numbers.

>two_sum_to_zero -> Write a function that finds whether any two elements in the array sum to 0. If it does, return true; else, return false.

>magic_numbers -> A magic number is a number whose digits, when added together, sum to 7. For example, the number 34 would be a magic number, because 3 + 4 = 7. Write a function that finds the first N many magic numbers.

>sum_to 

>largest_pair -> # Write a function that takes an array of pairs and returns the pair with the greatest sum

>capitalize_each_word -> Write a function that returns a phrase with each word (separated by spaces) capitalized.

>multiples_of_three -> Write a boolean function that returns true if an array of numbers has any multiples of 3.

>evens_and_odds

>letter_count

>palindrome

>reverse_digits

>longest_word

>count_initials

>compute_squares
